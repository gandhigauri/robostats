Project 1: The Weighted Majority Algorithm

One  application  of  the  Weighted  Majority  Algorithm  is  the  Prediction  with Expert Advice (PWEA) problem.  In PWEA, a finite number of experts will each make a prediction.  The online learning algorithm then chooses to listen to a particular expert or combine predictions from multiple experts.  The goal of the online learning algorithm is to minimize the number of mistakes/loss in the long run.

The theoretical goal of this project is to help understand and become comfortable deriving basic performance bounds for online algorithms for solving the PWEA problem.

The programming portion of the project is designed to help understand the actual implementation of an online algorithm.
